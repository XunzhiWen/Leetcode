/**
 * You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always
 * begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its
 * simplified canonical path.
 * <p>
 * The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A single period '.' represents the current directory.
 * A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
 * Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single
 * slash '/'.
 * Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated
 * as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid
 * directory or file names.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The path must start with a single slash '/'.
 * Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
 * The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
 * The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to
 * denote current or parent directories.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Return the simplified canonical path.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: path = "/home/"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: "/home"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * The trailing slash should be removed.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: path = "/home//foo/"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: "/home/foo"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 4:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: path = "/../"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: "/"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.
 * <p>
 * Example 5:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output: "/.../b/d"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * "..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 1 <= path.length <= 3000
 * path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
 * path is a valid absolute Unix path.
 * <p>
