/**
 * You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given
 * stock on the i·µó ∞ day.
 * <p>
 * On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at
 * most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then
 * immediately sell it on the same day.
 * <p>
 * Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-
 * 1 = 4.
 * Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
 * Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-
 * 1 = 4.
 * Total profit is 4.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the
 * stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10‚Å¥
 * 0 <= prices[i] <= 10‚Å¥
